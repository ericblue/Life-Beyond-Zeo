# Life-Beyond-Zeo

In 2013, shortly before the sleep tracking company Zeo shut down, a couple people in the Quantified Self community published some resources containing backups of firmware, docs and instructions related to the bedside and mobile headset.  One of these resources I published at http://eric-blue.com/2013/06/09/life-beyond-zeo/ had some outdated Dropbox links to the firmware, and I had a recent inquiry pointing that out, so I decided to pull those files directly from my own backups and assemble into a centralized place.  Although I haven't used my Zeo in recent years or tried to revive with the old firmware yet, I do have an affinity for Zeo after having spent years tracking my sleep using the product, and also working with the Zeo team on creating the open source Perl port of their web API (https://github.com/ericblue/Perl-Zeo-API)

This Git repo contains the following:
- Version 2.63 Firmware
    * The original 2.6.3 firmware circa 2010-2011
    * Version O firmware - Zeo Data Decoder Card Libary (enables a user to decode Zeo sleep data without uploading data)
    * Version R firmware - Zeo Raw Data Library (enables a user to view their sleep phase and brainwaves in real time using the serial port on the back of Zeo)
    
- Companion Raw Data Decoder Library

- Snapshots from archive.org from the developer portal

- PDF docs on the data export format
